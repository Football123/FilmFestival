            Scroll down to the restaurant section, look at the various restaurants and choose the one that appeals to you the most.
            For Frensch, you should check out Ratatouille! But if you want to try out some Dutch food, Restaurant ML, Restaurant Fris, Grand Cafe Brinkman and Urban Frenchy Bistro are a good idea!
            Pick a restaurant and add it to you chart!
